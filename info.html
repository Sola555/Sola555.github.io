<h1>Brief information about the logic of the bot</h1>
This bot is programmed using python and has over 4500 lines of code! Uses dictionaries to save data of players and autosaves into a txt file that can be found with the ,txt command. Instead of using discord buckettype cooldowns, uses asyncio to count in the background and updates variables every second to tell you how many seconds are left. 
<h1>History of Oasis Bot</h1>
<p1>This bot was inspired by Dank Memer which was a big currency bot that everyone on discord played. After learning how to make discord bots, I was really interested in making a big game like dank memer that was on discord. This bot works very differently from other bots because it does not use discord game engines but rather uses dictionaries to save data of players by ID.
